Welcome to my new site. It's built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. I'll post about web performance, DX, and interesting bugs.

## Why another blog?

- I want a fast, experimental playground.
- Long-form helps me shape ideas.
- I often forget thingsâ€”this helps future me.

```ts
export function greet(name: string) {
  return `Hello ${name}!`;
}
```
