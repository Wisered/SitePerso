This post is a reflection on my experiences during my ERASMUS exchange in Norway. **DISCLAIMER** I will only mention the academic part of my exchange, not the personal one (trips, cultural experiences, etc.).

## Why Norway?

First, let's address the question of why I chose Norway for my ERASMUS exchange. When I started looking for partner universities, I had a few critiria in mind :
    - I was really interested in going to a Nothern European country, as I had never been to one before.
    - I wanted to go to a country with a strong academic reputation, especially in my field of study (computer science).
    - I wanted to go to a country with a high quality of life and a good standard
    - I wanted to go to a country where I could improve my English skills, as I am not very confident in my English speaking abilities.

I had the choice between Norway and Sweden, and I chose Norway because of the course offer, which was more aligned with my interests (cybersecurity).  
I was now ready to start my adventure in Norway at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. 

## The university of Trondheim

The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) is the largest university in Norway, with over 40,000 students. It is known for its strong focus on technology and engineering, but it also offers a wide range of courses in other fields. The campus is located in the city of Trondheim, which is the third largest city in Norway.  
The campus is modern and well-equipped, with old and new buildings. The university has a strong focus on research, and there are many opportunities for students to get involved in research projects.<br /><br />

The university has a strong international community, with many exchange students from all over the world. There are many student organizations and clubs, which makes it easy to meet new people and get involved in campus life.<br/><br />  

# The courses

I took 4 courses during my exchange semestre, which were all taught in English. The courses were :
  - Applied Statistics
  - Finance for Science and Technology Students
  - Applied Cryptography and Networking Security
  - Software Security and Data Privacy

Let's take a closer look at each course and the projects I worked on.

## - Applied Statistics

This course was focused on the application of statistical methods to real-world problems. The teacher was American and had a very practical approach to teaching. The course was divided into lectures and exercices sessions.
The knowledge goals were :
 - Understand key statistical models and methods in science and technology
 - Core topics: hypothesis testing, regression, experimental design, ANOVA (analysis of variance)
 - Additional methods: error propagation, process control, contingency tables, non-parametric approach

At the end of the course we were able to :
 - Design experiments and collect high-quality data
 - Analyse data using statistical software
 - Draw valid conclusions from statistical analysis
