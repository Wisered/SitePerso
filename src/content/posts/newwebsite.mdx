Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my brand-new personal website. I built this space to **share what Iâ€™m working on**, document my experiments, and reflect on what Iâ€™m learning along the way.  

## Why this site?

- A personal playground where I can try new things and experiment freely.  
- A place to collect and organize ideas, projects, and lessons learned.  
- A way to keep track of my progress and make sure nothing gets lost.
