SafetyMap is a collaborative web application developed during my first semester at Télécom Nancy.  
The goal was to design a tool aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), giving citizens the ability to report urban hazards in real time (roadworks, accidents, poorly lit areas, etc.). The project emphasizes both technical implementation and social impact by encouraging community-driven prevention.

## **Key Features**

- Secure account creation with email verification to ensure user authenticity.  
- Interactive map that displays real-time reports of potential dangers.  
- Local statistics updated almost instantly to track the frequency and severity of incidents.  
- Collaborative reporting system: once a danger is flagged several times in the same area, it is automatically validated and displayed on the map.  
- Responsive and user-friendly interface, designed for both desktop and mobile use.

## **Teamwork & Contributions**

This 3-month project was carried out by a team of 4 students.  
I contributed to key aspects including **[adjust here if you want to highlight your personal part]**, while also collaborating on the overall development cycle:  
- Interface design and user experience  
- Backend implementation with Flask  
- JavaScript integration for interactivity  
- Security and performance testing  

This experience strengthened my skills in **full-stack development**, teamwork, and agile project management.

## **Tech Stack**

- **Backend**: Python (Flask) for request handling, business logic, and database interaction.  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive and intuitive UI.  
- **Database**: SQLite for managing user accounts and hazard reports.
