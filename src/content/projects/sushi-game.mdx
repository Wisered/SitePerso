This project was conducted during my first year at Télécom Nancy as a part of a 3-month team assignment.
The objective was to create a 3D adventure game using C and the SDL2 library, complemented by OpenGL for rendering. The game features a custom-built engine that handles graphics, input, and game logic.
The project provided a comprehensive experience in game development, from initial design to final implementation, while also fostering teamwork and project management skills.
It was not finished due to time constraints, but the core mechanics and features were successfully implemented. (few memory leaks too)

## **Synopsis**

Embark on an 3D adventure, stranded on the edge of a mysterious island, your goal is to explore its vast landscapes and uncover hidden secrets. To escape, you must find four legendary gems scattered across the island, hidden within unique dungeons guarded by creatures such as golems, skeletons, and goblins. With simple yet clean graphics powered by its very own game engine, the game offers a journey filled with discovery, combat, and adventure.

## **Gameplay**

In this expansive open-world adventure, players will explore a mysterious island, uncover its secrets, and solve intricate puzzles. The island is teeming with various monsters, and defeating them allows you to collect valuable loot. Trade this loot with a merchant located at the island's core to upgrade your gear, purchase essential tools for exploring hidden areas, and acquire potions to unlock powerful combat skills. Conquer bandit camps to retrieve hidden treasures, and delve into procedurally generated dungeons, each requiring a key to access the boss room where legendary gems await.
