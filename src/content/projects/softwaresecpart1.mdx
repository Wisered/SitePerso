The **SecFit Vulnerability Assessment** is a project carried out as part of TDT4237 (Software Security and Data Privacy) at NTNU.
It focused on analyzing a web application (*SecFit*) to identify **security vulnerabilities** using both **White-Box** (source code inspection) and **Black-Box** (penetration testing) approaches, based on the **OWASP Testing Guide (WSTG)**.

## **Key Findings**

- **Unencrypted communication (WSTG-ATHN-01)**: credentials sent over HTTP instead of HTTPS.  
- **Weak credentials (WSTG-ATHN-02)**: default `admin/admin` login found in the database.  
- **Brute-force vulnerability (WSTG-ATHN-03)**: no lockout mechanism implemented.  
- **User enumeration (WSTG-IDNT-04)**: accounts and emails were exposed.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (WSTG-INPV-02)**: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` allowed injection of malicious scripts.  
- **SQL Injection (WSTG-INPV-05)**: raw SQL queries executed without validation.  
- **Improper session management (WSTG-SESS-06)**: tokens remained valid after logout.  
- **File upload abuse (WSTG-BUSL-08)**: no restriction on file type or size, allowing malicious uploads.  

## **Methodology**

- **White-Box testing**: static analysis of the source code (Python/Django backend, React frontend).  
- **Black-Box testing**: penetration testing using tools such as **Postman, OWASP ZAP, BurpSuite, Hashcat, jwt.io**.  
- Vulnerabilities were categorized using OWASP references for clarity.  

## **Teamwork & Contributions**

I contributed to:
- Source code analysis (Django backend, React frontend)  
- SQL injection, XSS vulnerability discovery, and session management testing  
- Penetration testing using various security tools (ZAP, BurpSuite)
- Exploit demonstrations with Postman and BurpSuite  
- Documentation of vulnerabilities with screenshots  

This project allowed me to gain practical experience in **web application security testing**, **secure coding practices**, and **threat modeling**.
