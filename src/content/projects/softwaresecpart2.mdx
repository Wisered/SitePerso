The **SecFit Security Hardening** project documents the remediation phase of the *SecFit Vulnerability Assessment* carried out in TDT4237 (Software Security and Data Privacy) at NTNU.  
It focused on **fixing identified vulnerabilities** by applying secure coding practices, updating configurations, and aligning the system with the **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**.

## **Key Fixes**

- **Secure password hashing (WSTG-CRYP-04)**: replaced `UnsaltedSHA1` with strong algorithms (PBKDF2, Argon2, BCrypt).  
- **Session security (WSTG-SESS-06/07)**: enforced logout token blacklisting and reduced JWT lifetime.  
- **SQL Injection (WSTG-INPV-05)**: migrated raw queries to parameterized queries with Django ORM.  
- **Authorization checks (WSTG-ATHZ-02)**: enforced recipient validation before updating offers.  
- **Authentication (WSTG-ATHN-03/04)**: added `django-axes` lockout mechanism and protected routes in React.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (WSTG-INPV-02)**: sanitized user inputs with **DOMPurify** and applied CSP headers.  
- **Encrypted communication (WSTG-ATHN-01)**: configured TLS with Nginx, enabled HTTPS and HSTS.  
- **File upload validation (WSTG-BUSL-08/09)**: restricted file extensions, MIME types, and size with a `FileValidator`.  

## **Methodology**

- Applied **secure development practices** directly in the Django backend and React frontend.  
- Configured **Nginx** and **JWT settings** for stronger session and transport security.  
- Integrated **third-party libraries** (django-axes, DOMPurify) to mitigate brute-force and XSS attacks.  
- Validated fixes against the original **OWASP WSTG vulnerabilities**.  

## **Teamwork & Contributions**

I contributed to:
- Updating **password hashing**, **JWT session policies**, and **logout token blacklisting**  
- Implementing **SQL injection and XSS mitigations** in the codebase  
- Configuring **HTTPS/TLS** in Nginx and **file upload restrictions** in Django  
- Writing technical documentation of fixes and testing their effectiveness  

This project provided valuable experience in **secure development lifecycle (SDLC)**, **remediation of security flaws**, and **compliance with OWASP best practices**.
