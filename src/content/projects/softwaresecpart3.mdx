The **SecFit Threat Modeling & Risk Management** project is part of TDT4237 (Software Security and Data Privacy) at NTNU.  
It focused on **analyzing and mitigating risks** for a web-based cybersecurity risk assessment tool designed to support Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems, using **STRIDE threat modeling**, misuse cases, and a **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** created with OWASP Threat Dragon.

## **Key Business Assets & Goals**

- **Assets**: stored risk assessment data, reference lists, and the web tool itself.  
- **Goals**: simplify risk assessments, improve ATM security and safety, provide a trusted tool.  

## **Business Risks**

- **BR01**: Unauthorized access to stored risk assessments → High risk.  
- **BR02**: Tool failure (DoS/server outage) → High risk.  
- **BR03**: Inaccurate risk scoring → Critical risk.  
- **BR04**: Loss/corruption of catalog data → Medium risk.  
- **BR05**: Loss of user trust → Medium risk.  

## **Identified Threats (STRIDE)**

- **Spoofing**: identity spoofing, login exploitation.  
- **Tampering**: database modifications, catalog corruption.  
- **Repudiation**: lack of traceability in frontend actions.  
- **Information Disclosure**: credential interception, sensitive data leaks.  
- **Denial of Service**: DoS attacks on catalog or database.  
- **Elevation of Privilege**: privilege escalation via frontend flaws.  

## **Technical Risks**

- **TR1**: SQL Injection → SR1: validate/sanitize database queries.  
- **TR2**: Denial-of-Service → SR2: rate limiting & traffic filtering.  
- **TR3**: Insecure Data Storage → SR3: encrypt stored data.  
- **TR4**: Weak Authentication → SR4: enforce MFA & strong passwords.  
- **TR5**: Insecure APIs → SR5: API authentication & input validation.  
- **TR6**: Lack of Logging → SR6: tamper-evident logging.  
- **TR7**: XSS → SR7: sanitize user content & apply CSP.  
- **TR8**: Outdated Components → SR8: patch & update dependencies.  
- **TR9**: Unvalidated Inputs → SR9: input validation & allow-lists.  
- **TR10**: Broken Access Control → SR10: enforce least privilege server-side.  

## **Test Plan Highlights**

- **T1**: Automated SQL injection testing (SQLMap).  
- **T2**: Simulated DoS attacks (LOIC, Slowloris).  
- **T3**: Verify database encryption and unauthorized access prevention.  
- **T4**: Test brute force attacks & MFA enforcement.  
- **T5**: API fuzzing & malformed request testing.  
- **T6**: Logging verification during critical actions.  
- **T7**: XSS payload testing and CSP enforcement.  
- **T8**: Dependency scanning & CVE patch verification.  
- **T9**: Fuzz testing across inputs for injection vulnerabilities.  
- **T10**: Privilege escalation testing for access control.  

## **Summary of Findings**

By combining **business risk identification**, **STRIDE threat modeling**, and **technical risk analysis**, the team derived **security requirements and a test plan** that improve the resilience of the risk assessment tool.  
This structured approach ensures **safer operations, stronger system reliability, and higher trust** for ATM risk assessments.

## **Visual Aids**

- **Misuse Case Diagram**: illustrates unauthorized access scenarios.  
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**: shows data flows, user interactions, and potential attack points.
