The **Mini Python Compiler** is an academic project developed during the 2nd year at Télécom Nancy (Module PCL1).  
Its goal was to design and implement the **front-end of a compiler** for a simplified version of Python, called *Mini Python*.  
We built the compiler *from scratch* (no parser generators), focusing on lexical and syntactic analysis as well as abstract syntax tree (AST) construction.

## **Key Features**

- **Lexical analysis**: token recognition (identifiers, keywords, integers, indentation, etc.) via a custom-built automaton.  
- **Syntax analysis**: recursive-descent parser based on a formally defined grammar of Mini Python.  
- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: structured representation of parsed programs and visualization tools.  
- **Error handling**: explicit error messages (lexical and syntax errors) with line numbers; continuation of analysis after errors.  
- **Testing**: validation on both correct Mini Python programs and programs with errors to ensure robustness. 

## **Teamwork & Contributions**

This 3-month project (October 2024 – January 2025) was carried out in a team of 4 students.  
I contributed to :
- Factoring the grammar
- Implementation of lexical & syntax analyzers  
- AST design and visualization  
- Error management and testing strategy  

This project strengthened my skills in **language theory, compiler design, and collaborative software development**.

## **Screenshots / Examples**

The following code snippets illustrate some of the Mini Python features supported by our compiler:
```python# Example Mini Python code
def increment_if_positive(x) :
 if x > 0 :
  x = x + 1
 return x
if __name__ == "__main__" :
 increment_if_positive(3)
```

And then, here is an example of the AST generated for the whole program above:
