Welcome to the project page for my Modern Portfolio.

This site is built with Next.js App Router, MDX for blog and project content, Tailwind CSS for styling, and some handy rehype/remark plugins for nice code blocks.

## Highlights

- Static generation for posts and projects
- MDX content with custom components
- Minimal, fast, and dark by default

## Gallery

You can include images hosted in `public/` easily:

<img src="/globe.svg" alt="Globe" width="160" height="160" />

Or embed code blocks:

```ts
export function hello(name: string) {
  return `Hello ${name}`;
}
```
